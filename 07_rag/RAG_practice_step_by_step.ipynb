        "# Implementing a Step-by-Step RAG Practice with LangChain\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to this interactive notebook where we will build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system! \n",
        "\n",
        "In previous practices, we explored Extractive Question Answering and standalone Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA-2 acting as chatbots. While powerful, LLMs have a crucial limitation: they are prone to **hallucinations** (inventing facts) and lack access to private or recent data not seen during their training.\n",
        "\n",
        "**RAG** solves this issue by combining two components:\n",
        "1.  **Retrieval Component**: Searches a custom knowledge base (like your own PDF documents, databases, or websites) for relevant information based on a user's question.\n",
        "2.  **Generation Component**: A powerful LLM takes the retrieved information as \"context\" and uses it to formulate a precise, well-reasoned answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "To build this efficiently, we will use **[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/)**, a state-of-the-art framework designed specifically to make building applications powered by LLMs a breeze.\n",
        "\n",
        "### In this notebook, we will:\n",
        "- Set up the environment and install necessary libraries.\n",
        "- **Step 1**: Load and chunk a custom document to create our Knowledge Base.\n",
        "- **Step 2**: Create vector Embeddings and a Vector Store (FAISS) for lightning-fast retrieval.\n",
        "- **Step 3**: Initialize an efficient generative LLM using 4-bit Quantization (to run fast on free hardware).\n",
        "- **Step 4**: Assemble the RetrievalQA Chain using LangChain.\n",
        "- **Step 5**: Map our fully functional RAG app to a beautiful interactive Web UI using Gradio!"
